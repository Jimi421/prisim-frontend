## Database Migrations

Run migrations before starting the app to ensure the database schema matches the latest API routes.

```bash
wrangler d1 migrations apply JIMI_DB
```

This will apply `migrations/003_add_file_key_column.sql` and any earlier scripts, adding the `gallery` and `file_key` columns required by the upload and gallery APIs.
